# About

I am _not_ the author of this library and do not in any way maintain it.

This is a mirror of the original idefat-arduino library hosted at [Google code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/idefat-arduino/downloads).

References to WProgram.h have been updated to Arduino.h so this library works with the latest version of the Arduino IDE. See the original README.txt file for wiring information.

Tested on Arduino 2560 with a 32GB Hitachi IDE (PATA) drive
